# Tsashop - Ready React Starter

This is a ready-to-upload React + Vite project for **Tsashop** (General store).  
It contains a simple product grid, cart, and mock checkout. Designed for quick upload to GitHub and deployment on Netlify.

## What’s included
- 10 sample products
- Contact phone: +91 9943379617
- Pink accent color and simple responsive design
- Razorpay: placeholder note (not integrated)

## How to use
1. Extract the ZIP and open the project folder.
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
5. Deploy on Netlify:
   - Push the repo to GitHub and connect Netlify (Build command: `npm run build`, Publish directory: `dist`)
   - Or build locally and upload the `dist/` folder to Netlify Drop.

## Integrate Razorpay (next)
I can add Razorpay test-mode integration with serverless functions. If you want that now, tell me and I will scaffold `api/create-order` and frontend checkout flow.
